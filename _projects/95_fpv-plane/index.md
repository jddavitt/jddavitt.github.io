title: FPV Plane
description:  "In an effort to expand my skillset, I set out to design an inexpensive FPV plane inspired by the Youtube chanels AerostuffFPV and "xperimental Airlines. The plane is a v-tail tractor configuration with the purpose of slow, efficient cruising with the  capability to carry a small payload. I am activley working on this project as of 7/21/25, and the CAD images below show my first revision design, which focuses on the overall plane structure and major components. My plans for Rev 2 are to tweak the nose cone and ailerons
and start to integrate all of the flight electronics and FPV system."

- Onshape
- FDM Printing (Bambu Slicer)
- Aerodynamics
- Trade Study
- Project Management
