title: Senior Design - Buried Asset Inspection
description:  For my senior project, my team partnered with NAVFAC EXWC to develop a pipeline inspection device that operates without disrupting water flow. We designed and prototyped an additively manufactured, ellipsoid-shaped device that moves through pipelines using water flow, collects data via pressure and ultrasonic sensors, and can stop using a scissor jack mechanism. Our proof-of-concept successfully demonstrated feasibility, navigating 12-inch pipe bends and withstanding expected drag forces. While not fully waterproof, key mechanical systems functioned as intended which enables future teams to further develop our design. A refined version could enable non-invasive inspection of aging water infrastructure.
