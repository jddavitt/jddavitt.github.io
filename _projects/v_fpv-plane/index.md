title: FPV Plane
description:  In an effort to expand my skillset, I set out to design an inexpensive FPV plane inspired by the Youtube chanels AerostuffFPV and Experimental Airlines. The plane is a v-tail tractor configuration with the purpose of slow, efficient cruising with the capability to carry a small payload. Note 7/15/25, I am actively working on this project.
