  title: FPV Plane
  description:  In an effort to expand my skillset, I set out to design an inexpensive FPV plane inspired by the Youtube chanels "AerostuffFPV" and "Experimental Airlines". 
  The plane is a v-tail tractor configuration with the purpose of slow, efficient cruising with the capability to carry a small payload.
